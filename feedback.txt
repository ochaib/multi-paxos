The primary obstacle in completing the coursework for us was that one of us was sick for a number of days so we could not make as much progress on the coursework as we would have liked. Once we were able to make progress, the extension we had secured pushed the deadline to a Sunday, so we felt like we had less access to help from piazza and from lab sessions with TAs during the weekend days than we would have liked. The fully remote environment also was not preferable. Had the semester been in person, it would have been much easier to approach and ask for help during lab sessions. 

Because we were unable to get help, we spent a very large extended period trying to debug a part of our implementation in a language neither of us were familiar with. The requirement of using Elixir was not ideal as neither of us had experience with Elixir prior to the course. The only experience we had with elixir were the labs given as part of the course.

Another obstacle to producing a better report was the requirement of a fully functional implementation in order to begin completing the expected experiments and observations. If we were able to get enough help with Elixir and our implementation in lab sessions, we would have been able to write a much better Experiments and Findings section, rather than the speculation we had to write in the end.
